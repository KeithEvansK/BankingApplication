# Banking ATM

This is a project I made for a C# class that mimics a bank ATM. 

## The Project
The account number and beginning balance is hard coded but in a normal use case you would need to connect into a database to pull this informaiton. 

This project includes:
- Checking for correct data input from the user.
- enums
- custom methods.
- forum design
- data conversion
